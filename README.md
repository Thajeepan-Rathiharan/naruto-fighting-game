# Naruto "Fighting" Game

## Purpose
This is just a quickly made flash game where the user(s) clicks on the icon or character and animations play that deal damage to the other player.

## Outcomes
I found out it takes a lot of time and consideration into making them using multiple sprites for a single animation. Not only that but I have finally realised how much of an impact JavaScript makes to improve code written using HTML and CSS. Although this isn't the best flash game made by a coder, I think there is a lot of room for improvement but as of right now this is the best that I can do. Hopefully in the future I will come back to this project, or make a similar project with better knowledge in making a flash game.
